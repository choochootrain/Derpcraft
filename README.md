The Idea
--------
Minecraft except since I wrote it I can do what I want. Oh and its also crappy because I have no idea how this works so we'll see what happens.

Stuff that Works
----------------
  * gravity and physics
  * picking blocks
  * removal of blocks (but not collision objects)
  * inventory

Platform/Framework
------------------
JMonkeyEngine 3.0 Beta

Stuff
-----
wtf am i doing
